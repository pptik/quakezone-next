# QuakeZone Web App

## Projects needed to start:

1.  `quakezone-lb` REST API service:

        # sometimes needed
        npm run build
        npm run start:watch

2.  `quakezone-lb` GraphQL service: `npm run graphql`

    Updating GraphQL service:

        npm i --save-dev openapi-to-graphql-cli@latest

3.  `quakezone-next` SSR web app: `npm run dev`

See `quakezone-lb/README_human.md` for backend usage instructions.

## Editing the Project: Use Soluvas AppStudio

`quakezone-lb` and `quakezone-next` projects are mostly
auto-generated by Soluvas AppStudio, which is on different workspace.

Manually editing generated files will result in lost edits when these files
are regenerated.

`package.json` can be updated as they're only initialized once or
if explicitly regenerated.
